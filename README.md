# discreteHMC

'discreteHMC' is a Matalb toolbox to perform numerical inference over Hidden Markov Chains.  Implements forward, backward, and Viterbi algorithms.  
Currently works for scalar states and observations, with both stationary and non-stationary transition and observation matrices.

## To Do
- ML estimation of distributional parameters
- Inference while averaging over distribution parameters
- Add support for multi-dim states and observations
